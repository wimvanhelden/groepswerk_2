first time use: 

1) set up the virtual environment: 
	- navigate to the project repository in cmd screen
	- make a virtual environment with command >python -m venv venv (this can take a minute)
	(this creates a folder called "venv" where the environment is stored)
	- activate the virtual environment with command >venv\Scripts\activate.bat
	- install all the packages you need by running command >pip install -r requirements.txt
	- (every time you run this app you should first active the virtual environment)2)


2) set up the database: 	
	- open mysql workbench and make a new database using the script "create_database.sql" found in this folder (mysql)
	- that should have created a database called "groepswerk_twee_bart_wim" containing 4 tables with already some data in them

3) make a config_data.py file in this folder. This file should include: 
	DB_USER  
	DB_PASS  
	DB_HOST  
	DB_PORT 
	DB_NAME 
	password_token

	typical values would be (but this might be different for your system: 
	DB_USER = "root"
	DB_PASS = "root"
	DB_HOST = "127.0.0.1"
	DB_PORT = "3306"
	DB_NAME = "groepswerk_twee_bart_wim"
	password_token = "6548447e5e2e44e889e6e22e" (or some other long random hex)

4) run the server: 
	- in cmd screen: run command >python run.py

5) open the web application: 
	- in your web browser go to adress "http://localhost:5000/"


6) there are already some users in the database. To log in as administrator: 
	-email : admin@bookstore.com 
	-password: admin    


-- reset password does not send an email but sends a link in cmd screen....
